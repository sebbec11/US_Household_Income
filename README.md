# US_Household_Income

In this project I explored Household income from a diverse set of categories such as cities, counties, states, and environment.

<h2>Findings:</h2>
Regardless of state, cities tend to be the main factor in income potential due to factors like size of job market, company headquarters, and social accessibility. To help support this there is another finding that has been made and that is that Boroughs and CDP's have the highest average income and it is also true in states that are considered low in income compared to the rest of the United States.
